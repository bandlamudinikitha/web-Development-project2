Explanation

    HTML Structure:
        The form consists of an input field to display results and buttons for digits, operations, and functions.
        Each button has an onclick event that calls a corresponding JavaScript function.

    JavaScript Functions:
        appendToResult(value): Adds a number or operator to the current input string.
        performOperation(op): Sets the current operation (like addition, subtraction, etc.) and updates the input display.
        calculateResult(): Evaluates the current input string using eval(). It also handles errors and updates the display.
        performSquare(): Calculates the square of the current input number and updates the display.
        clearResult(): Resets the calculator to its initial state.

Usage

    You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to use the calculator.
    The calculator allows you to perform simple and complex calculations, as well as compute squares, with an option to clear all inputs.
